# shapes

revolutionary shape-tech

- Would have loved to use a params collection but it's not supported in this .net version and I'm not changing version for that.

- Squares can just be a wrapper around a rect, though optimisations can be made around it being a square and not a rect. Given the fact it's a rendering system (or could be later), makes sense to keep it separate...maybe...who knows I'll likely change my mind later.
